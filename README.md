This is my submission for task 03 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech

# Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to develop predictive models that aid financial institutions in targeting clients with a higher likelihood of subscribing to term deposits. By accurately pinpointing potential subscribers, the institution can enhance its marketing strategies and boost the efficiency of its campaigns.

# Dataset
This project utilizes a dataset derived from direct marketing campaigns (via phone calls) conducted by a Portuguese bank. The dataset encompasses various attributes including client demographics, prior marketing interactions, and the outcome of the marketing efforts (i.e., whether or not the client subscribed to a term deposit).

# Results
The project resulted in the development of decision tree classifiers using both the Gini impurity and entropy criteria. The models achieved high accuracy in predicting term deposit subscriptions, with the Gini impurity criterion slightly outperforming the entropy criterion in terms of testing accuracy and recall for the positive class.

# Conclusion
This project highlights the effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting client subscriptions to term deposits during direct marketing campaigns. By applying predictive analytics, the financial institution can refine its marketing approaches and improve customer engagement.

Thank you for reviewing this internship project submission!
